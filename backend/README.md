# Reveal Developer Test


## Objectives

This test aims at getting an idea about how candidates fit Reveal's standards in terms of backend software development.

With this test we will evaluate your **modeling**, **coding** and **testing** skills.


## General instructions

It typically takes 3 hours go to through this test. Be as thorough as you can, but every solution, even if incomplete, is valuable to us in understanding how you code.
In any case, also include in the README.md the things that you considered but didn't have time to implement, future improvements, and other considerations.
Plus we would rather see an incomplete tested code than a complete untested code ... ;)

At any step, if you have any question, do not hesitate to email us :) 

### Programming Language

In this repository, you will find some Python files that aim to help understanding the exercise.
Feel free to use **any other programming language among Ruby, Javascript, Typescript, Java** you feel more comfortable with.


### Deliver your results

Once you have finished working on the test, you can either push it to your own Github / Gitlab repository and give us access
or zip the code and send it to us by mail.


## Building a Partnership Suggestion service for Reveal Companies


The goal of this exercise is to create a workflow to suggest relevant companies that already use Reveal to any new joining companies.
This will be done by scheduling a sequence of emails containing suggested partners that a user can approve or dismiss.

To implement that we will follow the **[Ports & Adapters Architecture](https://medium.com/idealo-tech-blog/hexagonal-ports-adapters-architecture-e3617bcf00a0)**
You will build the **domain logic** of of the Suggestions Service.
For that, you need also to define interfaces between the adapters & the domain logic.
But you must not implement any adapters.

On the following schema the Domain Logic is represented with an Hexagon.
Adapters 
![Schema](problem_schema.png)


The workflow to implement is the following:
1. When a new company joins Reveal, the **Companies Service** notifies the **Suggestions Service** that it happened. 
2. The Suggestion Service must then decide which partnerships to suggest to the new company.
To do so, the Suggestion Service asks the **Companies Service** (through the **Companies Adapter**) for companies with same `country` and `industry`.
3. The computed suggestions are stored in the database using the **Persistence Adapter**
4. Any time a batch of suggestions is created the **Suggestions Service** then asks the **Growth Policies Service** the sequence of emails to be sent.
The response from the service is a list of tuples like :
```
[
    #  (email_type, time_to_wait_before_sending_the_email_in_seconds) 
    (1, 3600),
    (2, 86400),
    (4, 604800),
]
```
5. The **Suggestions Service** then ask the **Timer Service** to set a timer to be notified when the first email of the sequence
has to be sent (in the above example 3600 seconds).
6. When the first breakpoint is reached the **Timer Service** notifies the **Suggestion Service**.
If some suggested partners are still not accepted nor declined, the **Suggestion Service** asks the **Growth Policies Service**
for the title, content and recipients of the email to be sent. Those values depend on three parameters:
- The primary key of the company we want to notify
- The email type
- The list of suggested partners that are not accepted or declined. 
7. The **Mailer Service** can then be called to send the notification email to recipients.
8. Once the first email is sent the next emails can be scheduled and sent applying the same process 
(Timer -> Growth Policies -> Mailer).
9. At any given point in time after the suggestion was made, a user might accept or decline it in the **Web Application**,
which notifies the **Suggestions Service**, that persists this action.


You are tasked to implement the **Domain Logic** of the **Suggestions Service**.

The **Inbound Adapters** (which flow is represented by the green arrows on the schema) should not be present in the solution 
and are represented by the public interfaces of the Domain Logic.
Those public interfaces are the only way an inbound adapter can communicate with the domain.
An example of public interface is given in [`suggestion_service/suggestions.py`](./suggestion_service/suggestions.py)

The **Outbound Adapters** (which flow is represented by the orange arrows on the schema), should be classes/methods/interfaces which exist but their body is empty. In Python, they would only contain `raise NotImplemented`
An example is given in [`suggestion_service/adapters/mailer_adapter.py`](./suggestion_service/adapters/mailer_adapter.py)
